Foot soldiers is a sample delivery/logistics/shipping/courier provider.

Use this source code as a guide for implementing the courier code on your
own backend.


Tips:

We recommend you host this piece of code in a *non obvious* directory on your webserver
For example if your web server is http://deliver.co.zw/ we recommend you using a structure
similar to http://deliver.co.zw/callback/oneshop/ 

Structure:

index.php		-> Redirects to /
check.php		-> Checks to see if your service is online.
quote.php 		-> Calculates a quote for a consignment
dispatch.php	-> Dispatches a delivery
get.php 		-> Gets a quote for a consignment you are handling
info.php 		-> Gets info about the provider.
config.php		-> COnfig file


NB: Read the code to understand what is happening.


Expected post data:

Your API endpoints for quote.php and dispatch.php will receive as post input a json encoded
array which contains the necessary information for you to perform the quoting or dispatch.

If the information we provided is not enough you may query the user for more information.

If the user accepts or pays for the delivery using your provider you are required to send an 
http post request to the oneshop delivery api endpoint.
