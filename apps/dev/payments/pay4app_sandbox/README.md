Pay4App Localhost Sandbox Checkout
=======

Yes, our internet is not the fastest nor the most available or affordable. So here's a gem to have you work on your checkouts while you're offline.

Setup is very simple, and the docs will be improved.

Put the checkout.php folder anywhere on your local machine and then open it in your favourite text editor.

Find the *Begin configurations* section and set your merchantid, secretkey and callbackurl as you have set them in your application/website. You might want to make these different from your actual merchant details.

Do use this in your local enviroment only.
